Project Description:
The UPI Fraud Data Analysis Dashboard is an interactive tool designed to analyze and monitor UPI (Unified Payments Interface) transaction fraud for the year 2024. The dashboard provides a detailed view of fraud-related statistics, including total transaction amounts, failed fraud attempts, transaction frequency, and sector-wise and bank-wise fraud distribution.

The dashboard helps users visualize trends in fraudulent activities, failed fraud attempts, and patterns across different banks and merchant categories. This data-driven tool is ideal for stakeholders such as banks, regulatory authorities, and business analysts, to detect and mitigate fraudulent activities in UPI transactions.

Key Features:
Transaction Overview:

Total Amount: ₹50.04M
Total Failed Fraud Attempts: 20K
Number of Transactions: 10K
Average Transaction Amount: ₹4,988.5
Filters by Transaction Type:

Peer-to-Peer (P2P)
Peer-to-Merchant (P2M)
Sector-wise Fraud Analysis:

Pie chart showing the share of fraud across different merchant categories such as Electronics, Groceries, Travel, Restaurants, Entertainment, Utilities, and Clothing.
Month-wise Transaction Frequency and Failed Attempts:

Line graph visualizing transaction frequency and the sum of failed attempts from January to July 2024.
Bank-wise Fraud Distribution:

Bar chart representing the fraud amount distributed across major banks such as ICICI Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Bank of Baroda, State Bank of India, HDFC Bank, and Axis Bank.
Technologies Used:
Data Visualization: Power BI (for interactive dashboard creation)
Backend/Database: SQL/CSV files for storing and analyzing UPI transaction data
Frontend: HTML/CSS (for embedding reports, if applicable)
Data Source: UPI Transaction data (anonymized for analysis purposes)
How to Use:
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/username/UPI-Fraud-Data-Analysis-Dashboard.git
Load the Data: Ensure the UPI fraud data (in CSV or Excel format) is loaded into the project folder.

Open the Dashboard: Use Power BI Desktop or Power BI service to open and explore the dashboard file (provided in the repository). The filters and visualizations are interactive.
